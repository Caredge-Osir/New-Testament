        <p>
        The Church of God began in 1886 with only 8 men and now the church is all over the world. Looking back where we have come from, we cannot be silent to thank God for this far as we celebrate 40 years since we were established in Kenya.
        <br /> <br />
        The church is built on a very sound declaration of faith, the best doctrinal and practical commitment. The church administrative structure has made its growth with emphasis on unity, love, care and great faith in the biblical principles. This historical book is versioned by the current Seventy National Administrative Bishop Dr. David Gilbert Bwire.
        <br /> <br />
        The church is divided into six regions as follows: North Central region under the Regional Bishop and National Secretary, Samuel Wainaina; Nairobi region under the Regional Bishop and National Treasurer, Dickson Tito Mwalili; The Coast region under the Regional Bishop and National Education Coordinator, Benea Alukwe Amakhungu; The Western region under the Regional Bishop and National Prayer coordinator, Simon Ngure Ben; The North Western region under the Regional Bishop, Protus Pamba Orima; and the Nyanza region under the Regional Bishop and National Convention Coordinator, Paul Obadha Ohuare.
        <br /> <br />
         The church has over 28 Districts under District overseers and over 200 churches under pastors and a current population of over 8900 membership spread all over the country with the national headquarters at Karen, Nairobi, Kenya (East Africa).
